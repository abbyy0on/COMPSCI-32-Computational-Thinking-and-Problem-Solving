The "EdEquity" Project aims to provide updated data on educational inequities in US public schools. 
The project was inspired by the "Miseducation" project by ProPublica, which published 2015-2016 data from the US government  to raise awareness about education inequities (link: https://projects.propublica.org/miseducation). 
We chose to display racial disparities/imbalances in schools' demographics, AP enrollment rates, and suspensions.
